# Service Taximeter

A simple desktop application built with Python (Tkinter) designed for freelancers and service providers. It tracks time spent on tasks and automatically calculates the cost based on an hourly rate.

## Goal
This project was developed to address a real-world need: monitoring task duration in a service shop to provide immediate cost feedback without manual calculations.

## Features
* **Precise Stopwatch**: Uses the system clock (`time` library) to prevent time drift and ensure accuracy.
* **Real-Time Calculation**: Costs update dynamically as the timer runs.
* **Intuitive Interface**: Color-coded buttons and state management (enabled/disabled) help prevent logical errors.
* **Input Handling**: Supports both dot and comma decimal formats (e.g., 25.50 or 25,50).

## Tecnologie
